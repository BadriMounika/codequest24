**Best-Performing Student Recognition System**

I developed the "Best-Performing Student Recognition System" to identify and appreciate the top 3 students from each batch based on various performance criteria. The system leverages a dataset that includes multiple factors like GPA, academic consistency, hackathon participation, paper presentations, internships, and other contributions.

__Key Features:__

__Dynamic Data Interaction:__ The interface allows users to select a specific batch to display the top 3 students based on the current performance data.

__User-Friendly Input:__ Users can enter new student details, including GPA and marks, through an intuitive form. The system dynamically recalculates the overall performance score.

__Automated Ranking:__ Upon entering the data, the system recalculates and updates student rankings, ensuring accuracy and transparency.

__Responsive Interface:__ The design is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, making it accessible during the 24-hour hackathon.

__Real-Time Updates:__ The application recalculates and displays rankings instantly when new data is added, highlighting the best-performing students in each batch.
This solution aims to create a fair and transparent recognition system that dynamically identifies and appreciates the top-performing students, providing valuable insights into their academic and extracurricular achievements.
